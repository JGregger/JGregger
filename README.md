- 👋 Hi, I’m @JGregger
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, cultures, games, books, movies, music, health, coding, and all sorts of things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my skills to enter the web development field. I have obtained a degree in web development/design but I want to make sure I am continually improving and keeping up with new technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can learn from as well as contribute to progress.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is via my email joshkgregg@gmail.com
